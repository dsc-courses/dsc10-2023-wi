    "**Question 5.2.** In math, the word \"alternating\" is sometimes used to indicate that the signs of the elements of a sequence oscillate back and forth between positive and negative. Complete the implementation of the function `alternating_sign_mean`, which takes in an array of positive numbers, `values`, and computes the mean of **_every_ element** in the original array with **alternating signs**, starting with a positive sign for the element at position 0, a negative sign for the element at position 1, and so on. Example behavior is shown below.\n",

    "Suppose UCSD holds an annual lottery called the Lucky Triton Lotto, where students can enter to win Triton Cash, or even free housing! Here's how the Lucky Triton Lotto works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, you pick five **different** numbers, one at a time, from 1 to 31, representing the 62 years UCSD has been established, divided by two. Let's say you select (2, 13, 31, 5, 20), in that order.\n",
    "- Then, you separately pick a number from 1 to 8. This is because [16 Nobel laureates](https://ucsdtritons.com/news/2020/9/8/general-triton-tuesday-uc-san-diego-home-to-award-winning-faculty.aspx) have taught or are teaching at UCSD, and we decide to divide this number by two as well. Let's say you select 7.\n",
    "- The six numbers you have selected, or  **your numbers**, can be represented all together as (2, 13, 31, 5, 20, 7). This is a _sequence_ of six numbers - **order matters**!\n",
    "\n",
    "The **winning numbers** are chosen by King Triton drawing five balls, one at a time, **without replacement**, from a pot of white balls numbered 1 to 31. Then, he draws a gold ball, the Tritonball, from a pot of gold balls numbered 1 to 8. Both pots are completely separate, hence the different ball colors. For example, maybe the winning numbers are (13, 9, 31, 23, 15, 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll assume for this problem that in order to win the grand prize (free housing), all six of your numbers need to match the winning numbers and be in the **exact same positions**. In other words, your entire sequence of numbers must be exactly the same as the sequence of winning numbers. However, if some numbers in your sequence match up with the corresponding number in the winning sequence, you will still win some Triton Cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose again that you select (2, 13, 31, 5, 20, 7) and the winning numbers are (13, 9, 31, 23, 15, 7). In this case, two of your numbers are considered to match two of the winning numbers. \n",
    "- Your numbers: (2, 13, **31**, 5, 20, **7**)\n",
    "- Winning numbers: (13, 9, **31**, 23, 15, **7**)\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't win free housing, but you will win some Triton Cash. Note that although both sequences include the number 13 within the first five numbers (representing a white ball), since they are in different positions, that's not considered a match.\n"
