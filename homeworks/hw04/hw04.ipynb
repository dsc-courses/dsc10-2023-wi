This is a sequence of six numbers - **order matters**!\n",
    "- The **winning numbers** are chosen by King Triton drawing five balls, one at a time, **without replacement**, from a pot of white balls numbered 1 to 31. Then, he draws a gold ball, the Tritonball, from a pot of gold balls numbered 1 to 8. Both pots are completely separate, hence the different ball colors. For example, maybe the winning numbers are (13, 15, 25, 3, 5, 8).\n",
