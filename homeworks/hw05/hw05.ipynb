It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (see the schedule on the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or EdStem. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged."

These pages don't sell crystals individually, but rather they \"scoop\" a random collection of their inventory, put the collected crystals in a bag, and send that bag to the customer. What makes them _live_ crystal scoops is that these pages typically livestream the act of scooping these crystals for every order they receive and include the order number in the stream, so that customers can verify that what they receive is actually what was scooped. For instance, [@chloesmith.uk](https://www.tiktok.com/@chloesmith.uk) is one such page.\n",

When your order is finally delivered, however, you're disappointed to find that the total weight of the crystals you received is much lower than what you expected given what you saw on the livestream.
