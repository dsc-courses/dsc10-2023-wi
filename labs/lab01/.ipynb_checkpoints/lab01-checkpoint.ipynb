These topics are covered in [BPD 7-10](https://notes.dsc10.com/02-data_sets/arrays.html) in the `babypandas` notes. You should complete this entire lab so that all tests pass and submit it to Gradescope by 11:59PM on the due date.\n",

To save the result, you should assign it to a new variable.\n",
