    "Welcome to Lab 2! This week, you'll practice some DataFrame methods (especially `groupby`), create data visualizations, and learn how to write your very own functions in Python. Creating functions may be new to you, but don't worry, this assignment will guide you through that process! You should complete this entire lab so that all tests pass and submit it to Gradescope by 11:59PM on the due date.\n",
