You can think of the labs as being hands-on, interactive reading assignments where you'll get practical experience with the topics from lecture. In a given week, the lab will prepare you for the homework assignment, so make sure to work on the lab first. \n",

If you get stuck at any point during the lab, make sure to look through the lecture notebooks and readings linked on the course website. You can also post on EdStem or come to office hours (check the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar) on the course website for the schedule).\n",
