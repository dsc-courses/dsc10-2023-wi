    "Welcome to Lab 6! In this lab you will practice calculating variance and standard deviation, and converting values to standard units. You will use these skills to compare grades in a course and you will use Chebyshev’s inequality to predict how hard the students should work in order to rank in the top 5% of the class. Finally, you will use confidence intervals to help college administrators plan for next quarter by predicting the enrollment in a new course. The topics from this lab are covered in the following readings:\n",
