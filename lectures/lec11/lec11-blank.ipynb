    "- Almost every `for`-loop in DSC 10 will use the **accumulator pattern**.\n",
    "    - This means we initialize a variable, and repeatedly add on to it within a loop.\n",
    "    - The variable could be an integer, an array, or even a string (as in Homework 3, Question 4: Wordle 🟨⬛🟨🟩⬛).\n",
    "    \n",
