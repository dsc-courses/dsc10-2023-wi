## 🧐 About

Welcome to DSC 10 at UC San Diego! This course aims to teach you how to draw
conclusions about data. We will learn how to explore data and make predictions
using data. Programming is a useful tool to help us analyze large data sets,
and so we will learn how to program in Python towards this goal. We will learn
some of the core techniques of data science, and we will practice applying them
to real data sets from a variety of different disciplines.

Prerequisites: None. This course is an introduction to data science with no
prior background assumed beyond high school algebra. If you are not planning on
entering the DSC major/minor and have already taken a programming class and a
statistics class, you may wish to take a more advanced course. If you are a DSC
major/minor, DSC 10 is absolutely required, as later courses heavily reference
its specific content.

### Acknowledgements

The contents of this course come from UC Berkeley's Data 8 course, created by Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and many others. This offering builds off of earlier offerings of DSC 10 by Justin Eldridge, Suraj Rampure, Janine Tiefenbruck, and many others. Thanks to all those who have a played a role in shaping this amazing course!

## 👨‍🏫 Course Meetings

### Lecture and Discussion

There are four lecture sections:
- A00 with Janine: MWF 10-10:50am ([CSB 001](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237176))
- B00 with Janine: MWF 11-11:50am ([CSB 001](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237176))
- C00 with Suraj: MWF 1-1:50pm ([PCYNH 122](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237176))
- D00 with Puoya: MWF 12-12:50pm ([PCYNH 120](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237176))

There are three discussion sections:
- A01 with Dasha: Monday 5-5:50pm ([CSB 001](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237176))
- B01 with Dasha: Monday 6-6:50pm ([CSB 001](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237176))
- C01 with Dasha: Monday 7-7:50pm ([CSB 001](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/237176))

Lecture is meant to introduce to the main concepts of the course. In-person attendance is never required, but is strongly encouraged when possible, as you'll get the opporunity to ask questions, answer ungraded concept-check polls, and participate in discussion.

Discussion section is focused on exam preparation. Students will work through problems from past DSC 10 exams and go over solutions with the TA. Attendance is optional, but students can earn up to 2 percent extra credit on their overall course grade by attending at least 8 discussion sections (0.25% earned for each discussion, up to a maximum of 2%).

**All lecture and discussion sections will be podcasted.** Podcast recordings will be [available online](https://podcast.ucsd.edu/) within a few hours. 

You can attend any lecture section, but if space fills up, priority will be given to students officially enrolled in that section. For the midterm exam, you must attend the lecture section in which you are officially enrolled.

You must attend the discussion section in which you are officially enrolled. Students enrolled in Discussion D01 may attend any of the other three discussion sections, as Discussion D01 will not be staffed.

Note that the schedule of courses also includes a designated Laboratory time for each section (on Wednesdays) – we will not be utilizing this time for anything this quarter, so you can ignore this Laboratory time and schedule other things during this time.

### Office Hours

In order to provide you with help on assignments and concepts, the course staff
will hold several office hours throughout the week.

We are offering both in-person and remote office hours. See the
[Calendar](../calendar) for the office hours schedule and for details on how to
access both types of office hours.

Office hours are your chance to ask for general help, clarification on
assignments, and to review previous assignments. Our tutors have previously
taken the class, done well, and been trained in how to help you. Course staff
will not tell you if your answer is correct, and it is inappropriate to ask.
Here are some really good questions to ask instead:

- I got confused about a concept in class. Can you explain it?
- When the assignment says X, does it mean A or B?
- My code is giving a weird error - can you help me understand why?
- I can’t get this test to pass, so I must be doing something wrong. Can you
  help me figure it out?
- My code is doing something different than what I expected. Can you explain
  what is happening?

Questions that you should never ask a tutor:

- Is this the right answer?
- Can you check my code and make sure it is right?
- What is the answer?
- What’s going to be on the exam?

Your primary motivation when interacting with course staff should be
**learning**.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Technology

First and foremost, you will need access to a computer (or tablet with a
keyboard) and a stable internet connection to participate in this course. UCSD
has a Laptop Loaner program which may be helpful, but you should also contact
us if you have any concerns about access to technology. You will not need a
webcam for this course. Most students bring a computer to lecture, and a computer will be necessary to attend discussion section.

All course content will be linked from this website, but there are a few
additional platforms that you'll need to access:

- **EdStem:** We'll be using EdStem as our course message and
  discussion board. More details are in the [Communication](#communication-)
  section below. If you didn't already get an invitation, [join here](https://edstem.org/us/join/TqQEZA).

- **Gradescope:** You'll submit all assignments and exams to
  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/443300). This is where all of
  your grades will live as well. If you didn't already get an invitation to our
  Gradescope course, reach out to the instructors on EdStem.

- **DataHub:** Assignments in this course will involve programming in Python.
  DataHub ([datahub.ucsd.edu](https://datahub.ucsd.edu))  is UCSD's online data
  science and machine learning platform, where you will work on assignments. We
  will show you how to use it in class.

Make sure you can access all three sites ASAP. It's a good idea to bookmark
them, too (though they're all linked at the top of this website). You'll also
need a **Zoom** account to access remote office hours. You should already have
an account through UCSD; see the [Zoom guide][zoom] for more help.

[zoom]: https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/zoom-guides.html 

Note that we will not be using Canvas this quarter.

### Beginning of Quarter Survey

Please fill out this short [survey](https://forms.gle/PcQ2dMZmunReUKyN9) at the beginning of the quarter. This is required of all students.

---

## 💬 Communication

This quarter, we’ll be using EdStem as our course message board.

If you have a question about anything to do with the course — if you’re stuck
on a problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a general
question about data science — you can make a post on EdStem. If your post
includes any part of your solution to a problem (e.g. code), please make your
post private; otherwise, please make your post public so that other students
can benefit from the interaction. You can also post anonymously if you prefer.
Course staff will regularly check EdStem and try to answer any questions
that you have. You’re also encouraged to answer a question asked by another
student if you feel that you know the answer – this is a great way to
strengthen your understanding of the material.

Please use EdStem **instead of email**, as this helps us keep all course-related
communication in one place.

---

## 📕 Readings

Our readings will come from two free online sources.

- [Computational and Inferential Thinking
  ("CIT")](https://inferentialthinking.com) is the main textbook for the course, written to support UC Berkeley's version of this course, from which DSC 10 was adapted. This book uses slightly different Python commands (it does not use the `babypandas` module), but the underlying concepts are the same.
- [Notes on (Baby)Pandas ("BPD")](https://notes.dsc10.com) are a set of notes
  about the `babypandas` module, written specifically for DSC 10 students.

## 🧪 Assignments

### Lab Assignments

Weekly lab assignments are a required part of the course and will help you
develop fluency in Python and working with data. The labs are designed to help
you build the skills you need to complete homework assignments and projects, in
a low-stress setting.

As you complete the lab, you'll be able to run a sequence of autograder tests,
which check to make sure that your answers are correct. If you complete the
assignment and all the tests pass, you'll get a perfect score!

To submit a lab, follow the instructions in the assignment to upload your
notebook to Gradescope, which will run automated tests and assign your score.
You should verify that all of your test cases pass on Gradescope **before the
deadline**. Lab assignments will be due on **Saturdays at 11:59pm**. We will
release lab assignments roughly a week before they're due. The lowest lab score
is dropped from the grade calculation.

Labs must be completed and submitted individually, but we encourage you to
discuss high-level approaches with others. See the [Collaboration Policy and
Academic Integrity](http#collaboration-policy-and-academic-integrity-) section
for more details.

### Homework Assignments

Weekly homework assignments build off of the skills you have developed in labs.
Homeworks will reinforce concepts from class, explore new ideas, and provide
hands-on experience working with data.

An important difference between labs and homeworks lies in the way autograder
tests are run. Unlike the tests in the labs, the tests in the homework cannot
be used to guarantee that you have the correct answers. The tests in the
homework only check to make sure that your answer is reasonable, not that it is
correct. For example, if a homework question asks you to calculate a percent,
the test in the homework might check that the answer you provide is a number
between 0 and 100. **You should make sure that all the tests pass before
submitting your homework, but this will not guarantee a perfect score.**

After you submit your homework to Gradescope, and after the deadline for
submissions has passed, a new set of hidden tests will be run to make sure that
you have the correct answers. In the percent example above, the hidden test
might check that your answer equals 56, for example. Your score for the
assignment will be based on the results of the hidden tests, which won't be
available immediately after submission. So if you see a perfect score upon
submission, this only means that you've passed the formatting tests, not the
hidden correctness tests that determine your score.

To submit a homework, follow the instructions in the assignment to upload your
notebook to Gradescope. Homeworks will be due on **Tuesdays at
11:59pm**. We will release homework assignments roughly a week before they're
due. The lowest homework score is dropped from the grade calculation.

Like labs, homeworks must be completed and submitted individually, but we
encourage you to discuss high-level approaches with others. See the
[Collaboration Policy and Academic
Integrity](http#collaboration-policy-and-academic-integrity-) section for more
details.

### Projects

This class has two projects, a midterm project and a final project. Projects
are like more challenging homeworks. They are longer than a typical homework,
and they require you to pull together ideas from previous weeks, rather than
just the last week. Projects also give you a chance to explore a data set
in-depth, which can be a lot of fun!

Project tests are like homework tests: the provided tests only check if your
answer has the correct format, not if it is correct. You'll only be able to see
your score on the project after the deadline, once all projects are submitted
and the hidden correctness tests have been run.

Unlike labs and homeworks, you may work with a partner on projects. Your
partner can be anyone else in either section of the course. If you choose to
work with a partner, you must practice [pair programming](../pair-programming).
This means that you should work on the assignment synchronously, discussing
each problem together and writing each answer together, taking turns of who is
in control of the coding. Please read the [section of this website dedicated to
pair programming](../pair-programming) to learn more about how this works, and
some of the benefits of working in pairs. If working with a partner, only one
of you should submit the assignment, and you'll be able to tag your partner in
your Gradescope submission.

### Deadlines and Slip Days

Labs, homeworks, and projects must be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date to
be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before
the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it's a
good habit to submit early and often. If you make a submission after the
deadline, your assignment will be counted as late.

You have **six "slip days"** to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends
the deadline of any one homework, lab, or project by 24 hours. You cannot turn
in any assignments more than 48 hours late, meaning that you cannot use more
than 2 slip days on any assignment.

Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency
in deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an
assignment on its original due date. But slip days are also meant for things
like the internet (or the DataHub server) going down at 11:58pm just as you go
to submit your homework. Slip days are meant to be used in exceptional
circumstances, so you probably should not need to use all six, but if you have
something going on in your life that is impeding your ability to do your
classwork on time, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we can work
something out.

**Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, and you don't
need to ask in order to use one.** It's your responsibility to keep track of
how many you have left. If you've run out of slip days and submit an assignment
late, that assignment may still be graded, but you will receive a 0 on it when
we calculate grades at the end of the quarter. However, in the event that you
use all six days and submit another assignment late, we will allocate your slip
days first to the final project and midterm project, then to your homeworks (in
chronological order), and then to your labs (in chronological order). This is
done to prevent you from receiving a 0 on, say, the final project, if you've
used up all of your slip days at the end of the quarter; in such an example,
you'd instead receive a 0 on an earlier assignment that isn't weighted as much
in your grade. 

### Submission Errors

It is your responsibility to ensure that your work is submitted correctly to
Gradescope as a `.ipynb` file. Watch 20:05 and onwards of [this
video](https://youtu.be/Hq8VaNirDRQ?t=1206) to see the two ways of downloading
Jupyter notebooks as a `.ipynb` file.

When submitting your work, there are two potential errors to watch out for:

1. Submitting your notebook in the wrong format, e.g. submitting as a `.json`
   or `.txt` file instead of a `.ipynb` file. If you do this, the Gradescope
   autograder will not be able to grade your work, and you will get a 0. This
   can almost certainly be avoided by watching the aforementioned video.
2. Submitting the wrong notebook, e.g. submitting your Lab 6 notebook to the
   Homework 6 assignment on Gradescope. This will also give you a 0, because
   the Gradescope autograder for a particular assignment can only grade your
   work for that assignment.

To prevent these issues, it is important that you (1) double-check that you are
submitting the right notebook in the right format to Gradescope, and (2) let
the autograder run on Gradescope until it shows you under “Public Tests” that
all public test cases passed.

If you happen to make one of the above mistakes and the assignment deadline has
passed, you should reach out to a staff member and they will notify the tutor
in charge of processing assignment submissions. Since it’s your responsibility
to ensure that all assignments are submitted correctly, you will lose a slip
day if we have to resubmit for you.

## 📝 Exams

This class has one midterm exam and one final exam. Exams are cumulative,
though the final exam will emphasize material after the midterm.

Exams will be in-person individual exams during your scheduled lecture. You must attend the exam corresponding to the section you are officially enrolled in.

- Midterm Exam: Friday, October 28, during lecture (50 minutes)
- Final Exam: Saturday, December 3, 11:30am-2:30pm

We are aware that the DSC 10 exam conflicts with the final exam for MATH 20A. Fortunately, MATH 20A is providing an alternate exam for students with this conflict, so you should take the DSC 10 exam as scheduled and the MATH 20A exam at the alternate time provided by your math instructor. 

Students taking another course with a conflicting final exam should let us know right away via the [Beginning of Quarter Survey](https://forms.gle/PcQ2dMZmunReUKyN9) to see if accomodations can be made. Without express permission otherwise, students are required to take the final exam at the scheduled time.

---

## 📆 Weekly Schedule

To summarize all of the events and deadlines, refer to this general weekly
schedule (which is subject to change in any given week):

| **Sunday** | **Monday** | **Tuesday** | **Wednesday** | **Thursday** | **Friday** | **Saturday** |
| Nothing! 😎 | Lecture and Discussion | | Lecture | | Lecture | |
| | | <b style="color:red">Homework due</b> | | | | <b style="color:red">Lab due</b> |

---

## 💯 Grades

The table below shows how your mastery of class material will be assessed and
how grades will be computed:

| **Component** | **Weight** | **Notes** |
| Lab Assignments | 15% | drop lowest score |
| Homework Assignments | 35% | drop lowest score |
| Midterm Project | 10% | |
| Midterm Exam | 10% | |
| Final Project | 15% | |
| Final Exam | 15% | |
| Discussion Section | 2% (extra credit) | |

Note that each lab and each homework assignment will be worth the same amount,
regardless of the number of points it is graded out of. 

### Regrade Requests

If you'd like to request a regrade on any assignment, you must do so within one
week of the assignment being graded. If you think there is a problem with the
autograder,  please fill out the [Autograder Regrade Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9yDNvgRhHCnPAXanaB2ybopbTcrvY97lazspz2o26uopfww/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you think there is a problem with how your written question was graded, submit a regrade request through Gradescope.

### Letter Grades and Incompletes

We will use a standard scale for assigning letter grades. If you are taking the
course P/NP, you will receive a grade of P if you meet the criteria for a C-
grade, otherwise you will receive a grade of NP.

If you have extenuating circumstances that prohibit your completion of
coursework, you may be eligible for an Incomplete grade. If you are considering
using this option, the best thing you can do is let us know right away, and we
can help you decide if this is an appropriate course of action. If you have any
doubt about your ability to perform satisfactorily in this course due to
something outside of your control, please contact us as soon as possible so we
can figure out a plan.

## 🤝 Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity

The basic rule for DSC 10 is: Work hard. Make use of the expertise of the staff
to learn what you need to know to really do well in the course. Act with
integrity, and don't cheat.

If you do cheat, we will enforce the [UCSD Policy on Integrity of
Scholarship](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2).
This means you will likely fail the course and the Dean of your college will
put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Students agree that
by taking this course, their assignments will be submitted to third party
software to help detect plagiarism.

### Why is academic integrity important?

Academic integrity is an issue that is pertinent to all students on campus.
When students act unethically by copying someone’s work, taking an exam for
someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their
academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades
(and for the University to give degrees) that reflect student knowledge. This
devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it imperative for
the the campus as a whole to enforce that all members of this community are
honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be
proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD!

The UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the
standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your
good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot
list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic
integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations.

### What counts as cheating?

In DSC 10, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and the DSC
10 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete
your assignments. However, all code must be written by you (or, in the instance
of projects, together with your pair programming partner).

The following activities are considered cheating and are not allowed in DSC 10
(not an exhaustive list):

- Using or submitting code acquired from other students (except in the instance
  of projects, your pair programming partner), the web, or any other resource
  not officially sanctioned by this course
- Posting your code online, including on EdStem, unless privately to
  instructors only
- Having any other person complete any part of your assignment on your behalf
- Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else
- Providing code, exam questions, or solutions to any other student in the
  course
- Splitting up project questions with your pair programming partner and each
  working on different questions
- Collaborating with others on exams

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and are
allowed in DSC 10 (not an exhaustive list):

- Discussing the general approach to solving homework problems or projects
- Talking about problem-solving strategies or issues you ran into and how you
  solved them
- Discussing the answers to exams with other students who have already taken
  the exam after the exam is complete
- Using code provided in class or in any assigned readings or videos, with
  attribution
- Google searching for documentation on Python or babypandas
- Working together with other students on assignments without copying or
  sharing answers
- Posting a question about your approach to a problem on EdStem, without
  sharing your code

### How can I be sure that my actions are NOT considered cheating?

The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgement and remembering
to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage.
Here are some suggestions for completing your work:

- Don't look at or discuss the details of another student's code for an
  assignment you are working on, and don't let another student look at your
  code.
- Don't start with someone else's code and make changes to it, or in any way
  share code with other students.
- If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don't take notes,
  and wait an hour afterward before you write any code.

## 🤗 Support

### Accomodations

From the [Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD)](https://osd.ucsd.edu):

> _OSD works with students with documented disabilities to review documentation
> and determine reasonable accommodations. Disabilities can occur in these
> areas: psychological, psychiatric, learning, attention, chronic health,
> physical, vision, hearing, and acquired brain injuries, and may occur at any
> time during a student’s college career. We encourage you to contact the OSD
> as soon as you become aware of a condition that is disabling so that we can
> work with you._

If you already have accommodations via OSD, make sure that we receive your
Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter at the start of the quarter so
that we can make arrangements for accommodations. The Data Science OSD Liaison
can be reached at dscstudent@ucsd.edu.

### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to an inclusive learning environment that respects our
diversity of perspectives, experiences, and identities. Our goal is to create a
diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable
and can thrive. If you have any suggestions as to how we could create a more
inclusive setting, please let us know. We also expect that you, as a student in
this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the [UCSD
Principles of
Community](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fucsd.edu%2Fabout%2Fprinciples.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE1YPiUyffLg0kI10zLtUQl6iCDmQ).
Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be
different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is
respected and feels comfortable.

## 🙋 Waitlist FAQs

**I am on the waitlist, so how can I keep up with the course?**

Waitlisted to students may attend lecture and discussion, space-permitting, and can also watch podcast recordings. You can (and should) still submit assignments if you are on the waitlist. Waitlisted students should have access to DataHub to work on assignments. You may need to add yourself to some course tools; see the [Getting Started](../syllabus#getting-started) section of the syllabus.

**What are my chances of getting off the waitlist?**

The instructional staff is not equipped to answer this question. Many questions
about enrollment are [answered
here](http://datascience.ucsd.edu/academics/undergraduate/faq/). Please direct
your questions about enrollment to DSC advising. You can send an email to
[dscstudent@ucsd.edu](mailto:dscstudent@ucsd.edu), send a message through the
Virtual Advising Center, or stop by drop-in advising hours. In short, seats in
the class open up when students drop the class, which can be hard to predict.

**I have been added to Gradescope, EdStem, and other course tools. Does
this mean I am off the waitlist?**

No. Students on the waitlist were also added to all course tools, so they can
complete assignments while they are on the waitlist. Check
[Webreg](https://act.ucsd.edu/webreg2) if you are not sure of your enrollment
status.
