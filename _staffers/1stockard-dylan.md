Hello! My name is Dylan and I am a first-year Master's student studying Data Science. Until this year I had lived my entire life in Seattle, where I went to the University of Washington to study Electrical Engineering. Outside of school I love training and watching mixed martial arts, and hopefully will be competing soon!
