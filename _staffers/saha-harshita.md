Hey everyone! I’m Harshi, a 3rd year majoring in Bioinformatics and minoring in Data Science. I was born and went to high school in the Bay Area, but lived in India from the ages of 6 to 14. I look forward to being a tutor for DSC 10, since this course strengthened my interest in my major, and taught me foundational concepts I still use both in and out of the classroom. In my free time I read, play the violin, and due to my upbringing, love learning new languages.
