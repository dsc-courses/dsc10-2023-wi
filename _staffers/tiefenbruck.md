Hello, I’m Janine and I am excited to be teaching DSC 10 this quarter! I’m originally from New Jersey but I moved to San Diego over ten years ago for grad school at UCSD 🔱, where I studied combinatorics in the Math department. Since then, I've taught courses in Computer Science, Math, and Data Science. Outside of teaching, I love playing board games, crafting, and baking epic desserts! 🧁

I love DSC 10 because it teaches you how to pose and answer interesting questions in any domain, so it really opens doors and allows you to dive into topics you’re passionate about, whatever they may be!
