Hi, I'm Gabriel! I was born in Maryland, raised in Texas, and now live in California studying data science (second year)! Am excited to tutor for this class as it is rich with stimulating (sometimes mind bending, yet exciting) concepts! Outside of class you might see me skateboarding around campus. Come to office hours, you won't regret it!
